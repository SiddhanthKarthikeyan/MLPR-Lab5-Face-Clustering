# MLPR-Lab5-Face-Clustering
# Aim of the Assignment

The objective of this lab is to:

. Detect faces from a group image using a Haar Cascade classifier.
. Extract simple color-based features (Hue and Saturation) from each detected face.
. Perform unsupervised clustering using K-Means.
. Classify a new template face image into one of the discovered clusters.
. Understand how distance-based clustering works in practice.
